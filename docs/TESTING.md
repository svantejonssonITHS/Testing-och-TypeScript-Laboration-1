# Testing

The project has many different tests, most functions and components have been tested using a few different strategies. I have done `unit`, `e2e` and `bdd` tests of different kinds. The backend (api) uses `jest` as its testing framework as well as the frontend (client). The frontend also uses `React Testing Library` for its component tests. Application wide `e2e` tests as well as `bdd` tests use `cypress` and `cucumber`.
